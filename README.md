All these codes are written in MATLAB
my_paq.m file contains function to compute LU decomposition of a square matrix A using complete pivoting (PAQ = LU). Here, P, Q are permutation matrices and A is matrix given as input by user, L is the Lower triangular matrix and U is the Upper traingular matrix.
solving_paq.m file contains code to run the function and get user input of matrix A.
qr_factorisation.m file contains code to perform factorisation of square matrix A to an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R
